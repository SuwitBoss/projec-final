## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

### VRAM Allocation Strategy

```yaml
Critical Zone (2GB):
  Purpose: Essential models for real-time operations
  Models: Face Detection (YOLO v10n)
  Priority: Always loaded
  Eviction: Never

High Priority Zone (2.5GB):
  Purpose: Primary AI services
  Models: Face Recognition (smallest), Anti-Spoofing
  Priority: Loaded on first request
  Eviction: LRU when memory pressure

Flexible Zone (1.5GB):
  Purpose: Secondary services and batch processing
  Models: Deepfake Detection, Gender-Age, larger FR models
  Priority: Loaded on demand
  Eviction: Aggressive LRU, immediate CPU fallback
```

### Throughput Estimates

| Operation | GPU (req/sec) | CPU Fallback (req/sec) | Latency P95 |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Face Detection | 50-100 | 10-20 | <150ms |
| Face Recognition | 20-40 | 5-10 | <300ms |
